# Calcam
Calcam is a python package for spatial calibration of cameras (i.e. mapping the relationship between pixel coordinates in an image and real-world 3D coordinates), written for use with camera diagnostics on fusion experiments (but would work more generally). It is built on OpenCV's camera calibration routines and is inspired by an IDL code of the same name by James Harrison.

Calcam provides a set of GUI tools for doing the calibration of cameras and some usage of the results, and a Python API for then including camera spatial calibration in your data analysis chain.
