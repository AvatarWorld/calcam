Project Changelog
=================

Bug fix release 1.9.3 (11 Mar 2018)
-----------------------------------

Fixes:
* Fixed bug in loading legacy CSV format fit files under Python 3.6
* Fixed string formatting in exception handling under Python 3.6
* Fixed bug when checking if "Do Fit" button should be enabled which caused exceptions when loading some previously used images.
* Fixed image points disappearing when loading a different image of the same shape when they should be persistent.


Bug fix relase 1.9.2 (21 Feb 2018)
----------------------------------

Fixes:
* Fix inaccurate rendering in render_cam_view() for images with the centre of perspective not at the image centre (as far as I know this bug has existed since the very earliest versions of Calcam, but only now been noticed).
* Only enable "Do Fit" button in calibration tool when there are enough points that OpenCV won't raise an exception.



Update to 1.9.1 (18 Feb 2018)
-----------------------------

Fixes:
* Fixed exception raised when clicking "Apply" in the split field definition dialog.
* Fixed zoom not working properly in split field definition dialog.
* Fixed broken field mask behaviour when using 2-point split-field definition (and greatly simplify algorithm in the process).
* In point fitting calibration tool, fixed various GUI elements with text being cut-off due to being too narrow.
* Fixed a bug where performing some image geometrical transformations would cause the image to move off-centre in the window.
* Hard code version string in __init__.py; the way I did it before was stupid.
* Fixed bug where the numbers of paired and un-paired points was not being reported correctly.
* Fix off-by-1 issue when converting between VTK and image coordinates (effects point pair calibration and image analyser).

New & Enhancements:
* Make RayCaster class available in the root of the calcam package instead of only in calcam.raytrace.
* Switch to Sphinx for documentation. The documentation is not yet complete, but it's no less complete than it was before.
* Tweaks to launcher GUI including displaying calcam version in the window title
* Update GUI window titles
* Whether or not the 'Do Fit' button is enabled is now decided a bit more cleverly depending on how many fit parameters are enabled.

Removed:
* Removed unused exclude_feature_edges and include_feature_edges arguments in calcam.render.render_cam_view()

* Many other bug fixes (see commit messages)

New:
* Add setup script
* First version with a proper release tag, and add __version__ attribute to package
