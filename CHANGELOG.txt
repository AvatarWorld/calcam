Project Changelog
=================

Update to 1.9.1 (18 Feb 2018)
--------------------------

Fixes:
* Fixed exception raised when clicking "Apply" in the split field definition dialog.
* Fixed zoom not working properly in split field definition dialog.
* Fixed broken field mask behaviour when using 2-point split-field definition (and greatly simplify algorithm in the process).
* In point fitting calibration tool, fixed various GUI elements with text being cut-off due to being too narrow.
* Fixed a bug where performing some image geometrical transformations would cause the image to move off-centre in the window.
* Hard code version string in __init__.py; the way I did it before was stupid.
* Fixed bug where the numbers of paired and un-paired points was not being reported correctly.
* Fix off-by-1 issue when converting between VTK and image coordinates (effects point pair calibration and image analyser).

New & Enhancements:
* Make RayCaster class available in the root of the calcam package instead of only in calcam.raytrace.
* Switch to Sphinx for documentation. The documentation is not yet complete, but it's no less complete than it was before.
* Tweaks to launcher GUI including displaying calcam version in the window title
* Update GUI window titles
* Whether or not the 'Do Fit' button is enabled is now decided a bit more cleverly depending on how many fit parameters are enabled.

Removed:
* Removed unused exclude_feature_edges and include_feature_edges arguments in calcam.render.render_cam_view()
